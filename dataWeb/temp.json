      "additionalInfo": "The F-22 Raptor is considered one of the most advanced fighter jets in the world. Developed by Lockheed Martin, it is known for its stealth capabilities, supercruise, and advanced avionics. The F-22 was introduced in 2005 and has since been a critical component of the United States Air Force. Its design incorporates stealth technology to reduce its radar cross-section and infrared signature, making it less detectable to enemy forces. The F-22 also features highly integrated avionics systems, allowing for superior situational awareness and combat effectiveness. Its ability to engage in both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions makes it a versatile and powerful asset in modern warfare. Additionally, the F-22 can perform supersonic flight without afterburners, known as supercruise, which allows it to maintain high speeds with lower fuel consumption. Despite its advanced capabilities, the F-22 program faced several challenges, including high production costs and limited production numbers, with only 195 units built. However, it remains a crucial element of the US air superiority strategy. The F-22's participation in international exercises like Red Flag and Northern Edge showcases its capabilities and fosters interoperability with allied nations. Its deployments in operations such as Noble Eagle and Inherent Resolve highlight its operational significance in both defensive and offensive roles."
